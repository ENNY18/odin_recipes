  <h5>Vibrant Efo Riro stew and soft fufu on a white plate.</h5>

  <h4>RECIPE DESCRIPTION</h4>
  <P>Efo Riro, a classic Yoruba stew whose name translates to "stirred vegetables," begins with a 
    vibrant base of blended red bell peppers (tatashe), scotch bonnets (ata rodo), and onions, 
    which are fried and reduced in palm oil. This rich sauce is then deeply flavored with iru 
    (fermented locust beans) and ground crayfish, along with a medley of pre-cooked assorted
    meats and fish, such as beef, shaki (tripe), ponmo (cow skin), and smoked fish. 
    The final and crucial step is to stir in a generous amount of the efo (traditionally spinach, "shoko," 
    or amaranth leaves) 
    and cook it for just a few minutes until it wilts, retaining its bright green color and nutrients.</P>
    <ul><h4>Ingredients </h4>
        <li>vegetable</li>
        <li> palm oil</li>
        <li>locust beans</li>
        <li>pepper</li>
        <li>onions</li>
        <li>fish</li>
        <li>meat</li>
        <li>seasoning</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>cow skin</li>
    </ul>

    <ol><h4>Steps</h4>
    <li>Prepare the Proteins
        <ul>
            <li>Wash your assorted meats (like beef, shaki/tripe, ponmo/cow skin) and place them in a pot.</li>
            <li>Season with chopped onions, bouillon cubes, and salt.</li>
            <li>Add just enough water to cover the meat and boil until tender. (Tip: Start with tougher meats like shaki first before adding softer ones).</li>
            <li>Once cooked, drain the meat and reserve the nutritious meat stock for later. You can fry or grill the meats at this stage for extra flavor, but this is optional.</li>
            <li>Prepare your smoked fish: Clean and de-bone the smoked fish and/or stockfish (which may need to be boiled with the meats to soften).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
<li>Prepare the Pepper Base:
    <ul>
<li>In a blender or food processor, combine the red bell peppers (tatashe), scotch bonnet peppers (ata rodo), and one onion.</li>
<li>Blend into a coarse paste. Do not blend until perfectly smooth; Efo Riro is known for its textured sauce.</li>
<li>To avoid a watery stew, you can either pour the blended mix into a sieve to drain excess water or boil it in a separate pot for 10-15 minutes to reduce and thicken it.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Prepare the Vegetables
    <ul>
<li>Wash your spinach (or other leafy greens) thoroughly to remove all sand.</li>
<li>Blanch the leaves: Place them in a pot of boiling water for just 1 minute, then immediately transfer them to a bowl of cold water (or ice water).</li>
<li>Squeeze out all excess water from the spinach with your hands. This is a crucial step to ensure your stew is rich and not watery.</li>
<li>If you haven't already, finely chop the blanched spinach.</li>

    </ul>
</li>
<li>Create the Flavor Base
    <ul>
<li>Place a large pot on medium heat and pour in the palm oil. Let it heat up for a few minutes (do not let it smoke or "bleach").</li>
<li>Add the iru (fermented locust beans) and the remaining chopped onion. Saut√© for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>

    </ul>
</li>
<li>Fry the Pepper Base:
    <ul>
<li>Pour in your coarse pepper blend</li>
<li>Fry the mixture, stirring occasionally, for 15-20 minutes. You will know it's ready when the sauce has reduced, darkened in color, and the palm oil begins to separate and float to the top.</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>Season and Simmer
    <ul>
<li>Add the ground crayfish, bouillon cubes, and salt to taste. Stir well.</li>
<li>Add your boiled meats, smoked fish, and any other proteins. Stir to coat them in the sauce.</li>
<li>Pour in a small amount of the reserved meat stock. You don't need much, just enough to create a thick, bubbling sauce.</li>
<li>Cover the pot and let everything simmer for 10-15 minutes, allowing the meats to absorb the flavor of the stew.</li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li>Finish with Vegetables:
    <ul>
<li>Finally, add your prepared (blanched and squeezed) spinach to the pot</li>
<li>Stir everything together thoroughly, ensuring the greens are well-combined with the sauce.</li>
<li>Let it cook for just 3-5 minutes more. This is just enough time to heat the spinach through without overcooking it. The goal is to keep it vibrant green and slightly crunchy.</li>
<li>Turn off the heat and serve hot.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
    </ol>
