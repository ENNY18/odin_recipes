<h5>Two Moi Moi puddings topped with boiled egg and fresh herbs</h5>
    
    <h4>RECIPE DESCRIPTION</h4>
<p>Moi Moi is a savory, steamed Nigerian bean pudding made by first soaking 
    and peeling black-eyed peas, then blending them into a perfectly smooth 
    batter with onions, fresh red bell peppers (tatashe), and scotch bonnets. 
    This velvety paste is mixed with vegetable oil (or palm oil), ground crayfish,
    and seasonings like bouillon and salt, then often enriched with various fillings
    such as hard-boiled eggs, corned beef, or flaked fish. The batter is then portioned
     into individual ramekins, foil pouches, or traditionally, uma leaves (Thaumatococcus daniellii),
      and steamed in a pot with a small amount of water until it sets into a firm, moist, and tender pudding.</p>
